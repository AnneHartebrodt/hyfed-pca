## About
**HyFed** is a framework to develop federated, privacy-preserving machine learning algorithms. It is developed at the Technical University of Munich (TUM).
HyFed consists of three main components: 
1. **WebApp** to set up the (hyper-)parameters of the federated algorithm 
2. **Server** to coordinate the training and aggregate the local models
3. **Client** to compute the local model

To see how to **install** the **HyFed** framework, please see [HyFed-Install](hyfed-docs/readme/install_hyfed.md). <br/>
To learn how to **develop** your own federated tool using the **HyFed** API, please see [HyFed-Develop](hyfed-docs/readme/develop_hyfed.md). <br/>
To **run** the **HyFed** framework, please see [HyFed-Run](hyfed-docs/readme/run_hyfed.md).
