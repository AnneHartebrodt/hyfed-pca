# HyFed WebApp
The WebApp component of the **HyFed** framework provides the coordinator with a simple Web GUI to initiate the project, set the value of the 
project (hyper-)parameters, and create the tokens for the participants. It also displays the status of the project and provides a link to download the 
project results after it is completed. The **HyFed** WebAPP has been implemented using **Angular** 10 and **HTML/CSS**.
